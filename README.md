# TgBot

This project presents a simple Telegram bot for selling goods.

The Telebot library in Python was used.

The user gets acquainted with the product by clicking on the Catalog button. After selecting the product, the user needs to enter contact information for communication. Once the information is sent, it comes to your chat with the name of the product that the user has chosen.
